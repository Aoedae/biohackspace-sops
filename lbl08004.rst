Context
=======

The biolab contains equipment that is used for molecular biology and work with GMO. Equipment that has been used for GMO should be considered superficially contaminated (for GMO containment purposes), and should not be removed from the lab without following this SOP.

There are several circumstances under which it will be necessary to remove items of equipment. Examples are disposal or offsite repair. 

This SOP provides the procedure to ensure full and effective decontamination, or how to proceed if further assessment is required to obtain a certificate.

Scope
=====

This procedure is relevant for all users and their guests of the biolab.
This procedure is applicable to both non-GMO and GMO scenarios.

Responsibilities
================

- All lab users should ensure that this SOP is followed by anyone moving equipment.
- The person moving the equipment should ensure they have a cerificate of decontamination in hand before moving the equipment.
- When this process is completed the certificate should be signed off by the BSO.



Safety
======

The microbes that are in use in the biolab are categorized as Biological Agents, and as being unlikely to 
cause human disease (hazard group 1). In the GMO context, the microbes are considered 
to be of no or negligible risk to human health and the environment.

However disinfectant and antimicrobial chemicals must be used to ensure that equipment is free of these microbes before the equipment is moved.

The lab user is responsible for their own safety and that of others in the 
vicinity during any protocol or procecure they are carrying out.

Materials
=========

Disinfectant for decontamination is available in the lab. When performing these steps, the lab user should wear appropriate PPE including disposable gloves and eyewear.

Procedures
==========

Establishing 
---------------------------------------

#. Initially, the operator should obtain the user manual, or the service manual for the equipment and determine whether it specifies any procedures for decontamination.
#. The operator should then prepare for handling the item by wearing gloves and eye protection and if necessary a plastic apron.
#. A visual inspection of the equipment should be performed
#. Note any components that are damaged, or missing.
#. The operator should make safe any damaged parts, such as broken glass, electrical parts, or other hazards.
#. Note any componets of the equipment that can be autoclaved. These parts should be removed and autoclaved.
#. The operator should establish whether the equipment has any removable external containers, crucibles, carriers etc which would be a reservoir for microbial organisms.
#. These items should be removed, and each assessed seperately, as if each were a single piece of equipment.
#. The operator should perform external cleaning of the equipment with a Surface Cleaning disinfectant. (1% ClearSurf is recommended)
#. The operator should establish whether there are any means of ingress, by which GMO can access the internal cavities.
#. If deeemd necessary, the equipment must be disassemsbled to enable disinfection of the internals of the equipment.
#. The steps taken for decontamination should be recorded in the lab log book.

Restocking any cleaning materials used
--------------------------------------

Please contact the BSO to notify which items need to be restocked in the supplies.
